# WordPress AI Client Provider for Mistral

A third-party provider for [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) in the [PHP AI Client](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client) SDK. Works as both a Composer package and a WordPress plugin.

This project is independent and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Mistral AI.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- [wordpress/php-ai-client](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client) must be installed

## Installation

### As a Composer Package

```bash
composer require saarnilauri/wp-ai-client-provider-for-mistral
```

The Composer distribution is intended for library usage and excludes `plugin.php`.

### As a WordPress Plugin

1. Download `wp-ai-client-provider-for-mistral.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/saarnilauri/wp-ai-client-provider-for-mistral/releases) (do not use GitHub "Source code" archives)
2. Upload the ZIP in WordPress admin via Plugins > Add New Plugin > Upload Plugin
3. Ensure the PHP AI Client plugin is installed and activated
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin

## Building the Plugin ZIP

Build a distributable plugin archive locally:

```bash
make dist
# or:
./scripts/build-plugin-zip.sh
```

The ZIP is created at `dist/wp-ai-client-provider-for-mistral.zip` and includes `plugin.php`.

## Testing

Install development dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
composer test
# or:
composer test:unit
```

Run integration tests (requires `MISTRAL_API_KEY`):

```bash
composer test:integration
```

## Release Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/release-plugin-zip.yml`:

- On tag pushes matching `v*`, it builds `dist/wp-ai-client-provider-for-mistral.zip`
- For tagged releases, it derives the version from the tag (for example `v0.1.0` -> `0.1.0`) and validates committed metadata:
  - `readme.txt` `Stable tag` must match the tag version
  - `plugin.php` `Version` must match the tag version
- If versions do not match, the workflow fails
- It uploads the ZIP as a workflow artifact
- It attaches the ZIP to the GitHub release for that tag

## Usage

### With WordPress

The provider automatically registers itself with the PHP AI Client on the `init` hook. Simply ensure both plugins are active and configure your API key:

```php
// Set your Mistral API key (or use the MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable)
putenv('MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key');

// Use the provider
$result = AiClient::prompt('Hello, world!')
    ->usingProvider('mistral')
    ->generateTextResult();
```

### As a Standalone Package

```php
use WordPress\AiClient\AiClient;
use WpAiClientProviderForMistral\Provider\ProviderForMistral;

// Register the provider
$registry = AiClient::defaultRegistry();
$registry->registerProvider(ProviderForMistral::class);

// Set your API key
putenv('MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key');

// Generate text
$result = AiClient::prompt('Explain quantum computing')
    ->usingProvider('mistral')
    ->generateTextResult();

echo $result->toText();
```

## Supported Models

Available models are dynamically discovered from the Mistral API. This includes text models and, for compatible models, vision and function-calling capabilities. See the [Mistral documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/) for the full list of available models.

## Configuration

The provider uses the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication. You can set this in your environment or via PHP:

```php
putenv('MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key');
```
